# Spotify-Dataset-Analysis-Project

  In this project, I explore the data from Spotify using Python to gain a rough understanding of different kinds of music from various artists. I aim to answer questions such as 'Who are the top 10 most popular artists?' , 'What are the top 10 instrumental songs?' and 'how is the distribution of the danceability across all the songs in the dataset ? ' to provide insights into the overall musical characteristics. <br>

  The dataset was obtained from [ Kaggle dataset Spotify Song Attributes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geomack/spotifyclassification)
